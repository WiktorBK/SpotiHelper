# What is SpotiHelper?

[www.spotihelper.com](https://spotihelper.com/register)

Web app built with Spotify API and python. User creates an account and grants
access to their official spotify account. SpotiHelper shows recently played songs,
favourite tracks and artists. User can also create new playlist based on recent 
musical taste. 

Spotify won't send any data from non-premium account which means you must be premium 
spotify user in order to use SpotiHelper.

SpotiHelper is running on a server created with Gunicorn and NGINX.
